# Edge Detection

## Introduction

Edge detection is a fundamental tool in image processing, machine vision, and
computer vision, particularly in the areas of feature detection and feature
extraction. Edge detection is a process that identifies the boundaries of
objects within images. It works by detecting discontinuities in brightness.
Edge detection is used for image segmentation and data extraction in areas
such as image processing, computer vision, and machine vision.
